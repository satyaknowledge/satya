What makes some men winners in the world and others the losers? If you want to win, we must find the right answer to this very important question.<br><br>Are there certain qualities or techniques which a person can use to achieve success regardless of goal ?<br><br>To confirm this we must carefully study the lives of successful men of the past as well as the present day. No doubt there are certain characteristics that are commonly found among all these great people. But an academic or college education is not necessarily one of them.<br><br>Such an education perhaps could be an asset. But then considering how many of our educated youth are keen to take on a job of clerk and end up their lives as clerks one may even doubt whether the college education is really an asset.<br><br>Let us remember this. College education by itself is neither good nor bad. It all depends on what use you put it to. The important thing is, if you happen to possess it you can use it to advantage. If you do not have it, there is no real cause to worry. Many have succeeded not only in India but also in other industrial advanced countries having attained great success without a college education.<br><br>For instance, Thomas Edison had taken only three months' schooling. The great Abraham Lincoln was practically self-educated. Benjamin Franklin did not attend school at all. The Wright Brothers were not scientists but bicycle mechanics by their basic profession.<br><br>Success also does not necessarily depend upon one's birth, environment, wealth, etc. H.G. Wells was born in poverty and had to fight ill health continually. The study of the great, successful, self-made men all over the world, whether of the past or of the present, spotlights very important common factors.<br><br>They knew how to get along successfully with others. They knew how to sell themselves to strangers and friends, to their employers and employees, to their neighbors, families, in fact to everyone with whom they came into contact daily. They knew how to sell their ideas, knowledge, talent, and service. They knew how to get along with men, influence and motivate them.<br><br>Success depends to a great extent on what you do with your ideas, talents or gifts. Invariably it is not what you know but what you do about what you know. It is not what you have, but what is done about it that spells the difference between success and failure.<br><h2>Abstraction/Summary</h2><br>Getting success in life is never an easy task. The lives of great men show us how we can make our lives useful or successful. Education does not seem to have played a great role in making life successful. Again success has nothing to do with high birth or some special environment.<br><br>The most important thing is the human factor. One must know how to get along with others. A successful man is able to communicate his ideas in a way that he can sell them to others. He knows how to influence people and win friends so as to motivate them for a purpose.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 23, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-success.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-success.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F27%2Fthe-art-of-success.jpg&amp;description=The%20art%20of%20Success%20-%20Do%20you%20want%20to%20win%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-success.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-success.html&amp;title=The%20art%20of%20Success%20-%20Do%20you%20want%20to%20win%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/liberals-and-marxists.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/26/responsive/2000px-Forms_of_government.svg-xs.png" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/26/responsive/2000px-Forms_of_government.svg-xs.png" data-expand="300" alt="Liberals and Marxists"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Liberals and Marxists - Liberalism And Marxism Politics</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" alt="How does smoking affect your body"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="featured-posts__title">How does smoking affect your body?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
