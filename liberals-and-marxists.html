They think that liberty implies the freedom to do what one would like to do. This is true if freedom is interpreted in its absolute sense to mean that every individual shall be free according to his opportunities, there will be chaos. It is a lesson of history that whenever people are allowed to do as they wish, the clever and more capable used their freedom to con centrate all wealth and power in themselves to the misery and oppression of the rest.</p><p>Obviously the negative view is described by those who belong to privileged section of community and for this reason, seek to maintain status quo for the sake of their vested interests. They think that equality is unattainable under conditions of such unrestricted freedom. Lord Acton therefore, says, "The passion of equality made vain the hope of liberty."<br><br>The exponents of this view held that liberty is natural, equality is not. Nature itself created differences. For example, some are intellectuals, others are not. Liberty means freedom i.e., no restrictions : equality needs some restrictions. This is against the prin ciple of liberty. The institution of property is a natural institution and therefore, should not be restricted by equality. Perfect equality is only possible when enforced by state. This means the powers of state will increase.</p><p>Excess power of the state is harmful to the liberty of the people. Moreover, state has produced many evils of capitalism. It has encouraged exploitation. It has given protection to the capitalists. Such a state cannot give perfect equality. So, the hope of liberty also vanishes away. The democracy is said to be a system based on liberty and equality. But unfortunately, the democracy is either becoming elites' democracy or dollar democracy. Either this is controlled by the edu cated class or by the capitalist. Presence of elite or capitalist is inequality. Hence liberty and equality appear opposed to each other.</p><p>The liberals as well as Marxists have asserted that liberty and equality are not opposed to each other. Liberty has no meaning if it is not enjoyed by all. All may enjoy liberty only when privileged classes are abolished in the society. In a society of unequal, freedom becomes a farce. What is the use of expression of thought, when some are deprived ? A sound public opinion cannot be formed.</p><p>That is why R.H. Tawney observes that a large measure of equality, as far from being inimical to liberty, is essential to it." If there is only liberty, there will be anarchy. The liberty will be exploited for personal profits. Dunham writes, "A group of men whose social role consists of taking profits from other people's labour can have no profound belief in equality and fraternity as desired ideals." Thus liberty needs equality, so that there is no concentration of wealth in one or few hands. The Marxists have gone to the extent of saying that liberty and equality are closely related for a classless society. The liberals think that democracy can never be successful till there is perfect liberty with equality. Laski, a champion of liberalism writes, "There cannot, in a word, be democratic government without equality and without democratic government there cannot be freedom."</p><p>Democracy is based on political equality. Political equality is not possible without social and economic equality. In the absence of social equality, some Social class will dominate politics and in the absence of economic equality those holding the means of production will dominate politics. So in the absence of social economic equality liberty is just a myth. People may enjoy real liberty only where social and economic equality is established. This will make democracy successful. Thus, we find that liberty without equality is meaningless. We may enjoy liberty only when there is perfect equality. If liberty is to be viewed as positive thing then equality is pre-requisite.</p><p>The Marxists clearly stated there is inequality in the society due to the institution of private property. Many contemporary liberal writers expressed the relation between property and equality but Marxists scientifically analysed the question of equality in relation to property. They maintained that a classless society could only be established when private property is abolished. In a classless society one will work according to one's ability and each will get according to one's need.</p><p>The Marxists maintain that social and political equality is a myth without economic equality. In the absence of economic equality those holding the means of production will dominate politics. They refuse that the state can create equality in a class divided society through welfare measures. They believe that social ownership of the means of production in a given society is a precondition for economic equality. The Marxists accept that all distinctions cannot be removed. They say, "communist equality presupposes the eradication not of all distinctions and such conditions as would give rise to a difference in the social position of people".</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 20, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fliberals-and-marxists.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fliberals-and-marxists.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F26%2F2000px-Forms_of_government.svg.png&amp;description=Liberals%20and%20Marxists%20-%20Liberalism%20And%20Marxism%20Politics" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fliberals-and-marxists.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fliberals-and-marxists.html&amp;title=Liberals%20and%20Marxists%20-%20Liberalism%20And%20Marxism%20Politics" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/the-art-of-paying-compliments-real-praise.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1__3f0rAE9uPUFeQ2WoguQxw-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/25/responsive/1__3f0rAE9uPUFeQ2WoguQxw-xs.jpeg" data-expand="300" alt="The art of paying compliments"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>The art of paying compliments - Real Praise</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
