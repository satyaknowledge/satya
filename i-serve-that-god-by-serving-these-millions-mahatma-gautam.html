               <p>"Service is the natural instinct of man. Service is the basis of his life." The meaning of this statement of the novel Emperor Munshi Premchand begins to be understood upon the arrival of youth, when the person starts getting entangled in the house of the family. He is forced to do a lot for his wife and children with a stoic spirit, not because of any external pressure but because of inner motivation.<br><br>The law of service in nature seems to work at an unforeseen pace. The sun and the moon provide light and warmth to the world, the air provides a breath of life, the earth gives a place to live, trees give shade, etc.<br><br>They do not do this life with the feeling of any reward. They do this only by their innate nature. We also help the oppressed with internal stimulation only.</p>
<h2>Service Spirit is needed</h2>
<p>When we pick up an injured or unconscious person lying in a corner of the road and take us to the hospital, do we think that he will give us the reward for being good or that he ever took us to the hospital if we are injured or unconscious? When this service spirit is developed continuously, then it becomes the virtue of the person and the personality of the society.<br><br>People who have service and do not make selfishness the goal of life, there is no shortage of people who support them. According to Goswami Tulsidas, 'Seva-dharmaÂ kathin jag jana' means that the world knows that serving is very difficult work.<br><br>Self-sacrifice and disobedience are absolutely essential in service. A person without ego, every particle of the world; He thinks like himself, everyone is selfish for him. At least he does not consider anyone younger than himself, hey, frivolous or inferior and feels oneness with pranamatra.<br><br>He performs each of his tasks with a sense of service to the Supreme Lord. Through service, he has self-realization or vision of God. In the context of self-interview, service is both elaborate means and practicable, that is, the fruit of service is nothing but the enjoyment received by the service. Just as devotion results in devotion.<br><br>The service of the creatures of the world is the true service-worship and devotion of the world. It is written in the scripture of Christians that if you cannot love your neighbor, whom you see regularly, then how will you be able to love the God whom you have never seen?<br><br>Mahatma Gautam has said in very clear words that the one who has to serve me, should serve the victims. Mahatma Gandhi has also said that God is sitting in the hearts of millions of the dumb; I do not believe in any other God except Him. I serve that God by serving these millions.</p>
