Because of this it remains unhealthy. Request that you explain this and get rid of this habit.<br><br>The monk said come a week later. The woman arrived a week later with her son. The monk then said to come after a week. Thus four weeks passed. When the parents reached the fifth time, the monk asked the son - why do you eat so much jaggery? Stop eating jaggery. The son stopped eating jaggery from the next day.<br><br>Mother went and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the monk and asked - Baba why did you take five weeks to say this? Baba smilingly replied - I used to eat jaggery myself. Till I do not stop eating jaggery on my own, then from which mouth would I ask the child to stop eating jaggery. In five weeks, I had stopped eating good food. For this reason, my statement affected the child and his desired result was revealed.</p><h2>Moral of the Story</h2><p><br>We can see for ourselves that our leaders regularly give big lectures, but they have no effect, because there is no moral force behind the speaker's speech. On the contrary, when Mahatma Gandhi used to say these things, thousands of people agreed to obey him and were ready to sacrifice everything. Mahatma ji used to say what he used to do and do what he used to say.<br><br>By working according to the statement, the self-power that is created in a person's speech, through this, the force and effectiveness are added to the speech. People who do good things and do not behave accordingly.<br><br>The lack of harmony between words and actions makes the resolving power weak, as a result of which the moral strength and confidence of the person is eroded and he remains as a mere voice. Such a person can be attractive like a flower of seminal flower, but they are completely immaterial. They are of no use to society.<br><br>In the present tense, everyone is heard saying that visions of truth have become rare nowadays, lie has spoken, character has fallen: etc. After considering it, the reason for all these anomalies and inconsistencies is easily understood.<br><br>Everyone expects truth from others and does not speak the truth himself. That is, each person reserves the responsibility of ethics to other persons by keeping false information safe for himself.<br><br>Consider for yourself what authority a father who drinks alcohol can tell his son to abstain from? Leaders who violate the rules of law in Parliament and Vidhan Sabha and take the path of violence to make their point heard. Why can we hope that our youth will be disciplined and put their power in creative works.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 27, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fstop-eating-jaggery-an-inspirational-short-story.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fstop-eating-jaggery-an-inspirational-short-story.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F6%2Fan-inspirational-story-stop-eating-jaggery.jpg&amp;description=Stop%20Eating%20Jaggery%20-%20An%20Inspirational%20Short%20Story" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fstop-eating-jaggery-an-inspirational-short-story.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fstop-eating-jaggery-an-inspirational-short-story.html&amp;title=Stop%20Eating%20Jaggery%20-%20An%20Inspirational%20Short%20Story" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/allopathy-homeopathy-ayurveda-which-one-is-better.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/5/responsive/ayurveda-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/5/responsive/ayurveda-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Allopathy, Homeopathy, Ayurveda"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Allopathy, Homeopathy, Ayurveda -
