For some, the world is heaven, for some, hell. For some, if the world is the face of peace, trouble, pain, etc., for someone, there is a garden full of happiness. Under the same circumstances, there is an extraordinary difference in the difference of opinion between two people with the same prosperity.<br><br>In one life, training experiences happiness, peace, satisfaction, and the other spends life in times of pain, grief. Not only this, many people are happy even after spending a life lacking difficulty, and many consider life to be hellish, even after being prosperous. One person remains contented in his circumstances and thanks God for life, the other remains dissatisfied even after getting many pleasures. Curses others, merely because of their own thoughts.<br><br>The ancient sage-sage Aranyak lived a happy and happy life after eating life of candle fruit and lived in a heavenly feeling on earth. Whereas today, there is a human who is troubled by more tribulation, disturbance, sorrow, ecstasy, even after living a life with ample comfort, prosperity, Aishwarya, scientific means. This is the result of thinking of humans.<br><br>Famous English writer Swart used to mourn each of his birthdays by wearing black and ragged clothes. He used to say- "I would not have got this life, I would not have come in the world."<br><br>In contrast, the blind poet Milton used to say- "Thank God, who gave me the priceless gift of living".<br><br>Napoleon Bonaparte said in his last days - "Sadly, I did not spend a week of my life in peace."
