Most people tend to equate happiness with fun, good living, plenty of money. If happiness were synonymous with all this, rich people with all their luxuries and countless parties would be perpetually happy. But in actual fact, they are, frequently, acutely unhappy, despite their riches and ability to indulge in fun activities at will. Fun is what we experience during an act; happiness is that intangible something we experience after an act. We may have fun watching a movie, going shopping, meeting friends-these are all fun activities that afford us fleeting moments of relaxation and enjoyment. Happiness, on the other hand, is a much stronger, deeper and more abiding emotion.<br><br>If we perceive happiness as the ultimate goal, we must also devise a way to reach that goal. The way to happiness is not a smooth, broad highway along which we can cruise at a comfortable speed. It is a path through rocky and rugged terrain and the going can become very tough at times. At these times we have to roll up our sleeves and with pitchfork and shovel make our way onwards. This pursuit of happiness lasts a lifetime. Great happiness is earned only by great effort and effort not in spurts but diligent, constant effort. In this connection we are confronted with another fallacy, that fun and pleasure mean happiness and thus pain, its corollary, must be synonymous with unhappiness. But in fact, the truth is quite different. Things that bring us happiness, more often than not, involve some amount of pain. It is because of the misconception that people avoid the very endeavor that is the source of true happiness. Difficult endeavors - such as the raising of children, establishing deeper relationships with loved ones, trying to do something worthwhile in life - hold the promise of a world of happiness.<br>Happiness is not a permanent vacation. Another prevalent belief is that if one were rich enough not to have to work one would be blissfully happy. But a job is more than just a paycheque. Almost all religions teach us that work is worship. Work holds the key to happiness as doing something which increases confidence and self-worth. It brings on a feeling of satisfaction, of doing something, of contributing. Job satisfaction comes less from how much one earns than from the challenge of the job. Of course the pay-cheques count. It would be unrealistic to suggest that one could be happy without basic shelter, roaming the streets on an empty stomach.<br><br>A secret ingredient of happiness is contentment. Contentment here does not mean apathy or lack of ambition, just as commitment does not mean curtailment of freedom. Commitment teaches us to give so that we may receive and contentment helps us to cherish the gifts we have received. These things are worth a try even if they don't promise access to the pinnacle of success. Success, after all, has been described as getting what one wants, whereas happiness is liking what one gets.<br><h2>Summary</h2><br>Happiness defies definition. It is not synonymous with fun, good living or wealth. The rich are unhappy in spite of all these things. Fun activities give us only fleeting moments of enjoyment. Happiness, on the other hand, is a deeper and more abiding emotion. The way to happiness is not smooth. We have to make your own way. The pursuit of happiness is a long and lifetime experience. It is a fallacy to equate happiness with fun and pleasure. Work holds the key to happiness. Contentment brings happiness. Success means getting what one wants but happiness is liking what one gets.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 10, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpursuit-of-happiness.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpursuit-of-happiness.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F21%2Fhapiness.jpg&amp;description=Pursuit%20of%20Happiness%20-%20Ultimate%20Goal" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpursuit-of-happiness.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpursuit-of-happiness.html&amp;title=Pursuit%20of%20Happiness%20-%20Ultimate%20Goal" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/power-of-faith-faith-shakes-mountains.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Faith-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/20/responsive/Faith-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Power of Faith"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Power of Faith - Faith shakes mountains</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-television-affect-our-lives.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How does television affect our lives?</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/22/responsive/tv-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/22/responsive/tv-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How does television affect our lives"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
