The reason we have done this has been that we consider these moral beliefs to be a means of making our life happy and believe that without them human life becomes distorted and painful.<br><br>But on the contrary, when we see that those who live a life of untruth, cheating and dishonesty are not happy, but vice versa, then it becomes questionable that moral beliefs like truth, duty and honesty etc. should be given to us. Whether to base Because it is a matter of experience that every person in the world shows truth, truthfulness and honesty for goodness and it says that these should be the basis of our life.<br><br>But in actual practice, innumerable people appear to be giving up these ideals when they see that walking on them does not solve the real problems of life and people who do not care for them lead a more happy life in the world. Why do most people not accept truth and honesty? In this context, a story related to dishonesty and honesty is very relevant.</p><h2>Honesty and Dishonesty</h2><p>It is said that once honesty and dishonesty went to bathe in a river. After taking off their clothes for bathing, both of them took a dip in the river with the race to take a long dip. Dishonesty came out of the water quickly due to its tendency and after wearing the clothes of honesty, went away from there.<br><br>When honesty later came out of the water and could not find her clothes on the banks of the river, she was confused because she did not want to be dishonest by wearing Dishonesty's clothes. In such a situation, he thought to be nude.<br><br>It is said that since then, honesty is naked and her clothes have been worn by Dishonesty. As a result, people who want to avoid nudity, adopt Dishonesty wearing honesty clothes and remain attuned to them as long as they can recognize the reality of Dishonesty. Because many problems of people are easily solved with the help of it.<br><br>According to the story, this is the reason that honesty has fallen alone in the world and there are very few people to adopt it; Whereas people who adopt dishonesty and live with it are numerous and they do not consider it bad but good.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 29, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwhy-honesty-is-naked.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwhy-honesty-is-naked.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F16%2Fplato-quote.jpg&amp;description=Why%20Honesty%20is%20naked%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwhy-honesty-is-naked.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwhy-honesty-is-naked.html&amp;title=Why%20Honesty%20is%20naked%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-to-avoid-evil.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How to avoid evil"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How to avoid evil? - Great Thoughts</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/bharat-ratna-mokshagundam-visvesvaraya.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya - A great Inspiration</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" data-expand="300" alt="Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
