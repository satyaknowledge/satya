It had its beginning in mektabs, the Arabic term for school. Though there is no indication as to where they were first established, mektabs were certainly widespread by the fourteenth century AD in capital cities like Samarkand. They were to be the foundation upon which the concept of madrassas, established by the rulers, would rest.</p><h3>Madrassah</h3><p><br>The word madrassah comes from the Arabic word dras which means learning. The madrassah is, therefore, the place of learning and the mudaris is the person who imparts this learning. One of the earliest madrassahs had its beginning in the ninth century near the Jama Masjid in Old Delhi-a strong and massive building-followed by some thousand more in Delhi alone. The fourteenth-century Madrassah Firoziyah still stands today, although in ruins, in the lovely setting of the Hauz Khas Tank, Famous teachers such as Sheikh Rumi and Sheikh Jamal-al-Hussaini brought fame to the madrassahs by their erudition.<br><br>Madrassas evolved in three stages. There were at first only Arabic studies at mosques. The masjid was effectively the instructional center where, quite naturally, the recitation of the Holy Koran was the main concern. This stage was followed by the complex becoming the masjidi khan or the lodging place. It was not so much a Sarai or dera for travelers but a resting place for scholars and teachers who had reason to come here from other towns.<br><br>The madrassah proper was a combination of the two stages. The center as a place of learning was now an established concept. Pupils sat at the feet of famous scholars and listened to them. The apprentice or muid was an unquestioning repeater of the Word. He would either learn from the mudaris or the ifada, a person qualified to teach the Master's Word.<br><br>The architectural style of the madrassah developed along with functional concepts that remain valid to this day. Naturally, the style was closely linked to that of the mosque. They were never remote places of quiet learning but were instead almost always built-in busy market places. They formed centers of influence on the community they were set to serve.<br><br>The focal point of a madrassah in the mosque. Around a large courtyard centered by a pool, the three sides, usually double-storeyed, had long, cool arched arcades with deep recesses for classrooms or darskhanas.<br><br>A new feature was a high vaulted, open hall called the iwan which served as the 9 meeting place. On the first floor, repeating the structure of the ground floor were cells or hudira where the students lived. Simple furniture comprising long, low benches to place the books of the study were the only decor. The floor covering was equally basic. The madrassahs set before themselves the simplest tasks. Their aims were direct so as to produce a true believer.<br><br>To this day the direction remains unchanged whether it is in the famous madrasa at Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh or the more modestly placed Madrasa Aminia at Kashmiri Gate in Delhi. The concept of a true believer has come to be understood not in terms of a repetition of litany but a human being who will live according to the precepts of Islamic values. Such values, truly understood, do not lead the student into a rabid and unbending approach.<br><br>Rather, they help him relate to significant cardinal points and to live by an acceptable code of conduct. Relevant to such exposure and imbibing of moral values are the attitudes that people later bring to their professional lives. When the students reach the point of optimum growth in their learning process and cannot meet the high standards of academics, they stream out into different professions.<br><br>Significantly, most of the pupils are from very low-income groups and will return to become artisans, leather-workers, tailors, or indeed any such simple jobs available. To these professions, they will add a pride of skill and lend to their demeanor a dignity of behavior. This is the tehzeeb which is a direct benefit of his years spent at the madrassah. This is not to say that misbehavior is absent.<br><br>However, the exposure to the madrassah, which channelizes its pupils to live according to certain principled structures, can prove to be an important asset. Unfortunately, the madrassahs do not provide any vocational training which can help the youth earn a livelihood. No amount of moral perfection can replace a solid foundation of a craft.<br><br>This question has not been suitably dealt with by any of the heads of the madrassahs although change along such lines would be relevant in the modern context.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on April 16, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistory-behind-madrassah.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistory-behind-madrassah.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F29%2FIslamic-education.jpg&amp;description=History%20Behind%20Madrassah%20-%20Islamic%20education" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistory-behind-madrassah.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistory-behind-madrassah.html&amp;title=History%20Behind%20Madrassah%20-%20Islamic%20education" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/tundra-region-climate-facts.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/28/responsive/tundra-region-facts-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/28/responsive/tundra-region-facts-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Tundra Region facts"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Tundra Region - Climate, Facts and Information</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/we-must-struggle.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>We must Struggle | Are you Struggling?</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/30/responsive/rock-ball-struggle-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/30/responsive/rock-ball-struggle-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="We must Struggle"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" alt="How does smoking affect your body"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="featured-posts__title">How does smoking affect your body?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
