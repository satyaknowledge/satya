Changes in sleep have an effect on human performance and health.<br><br>In today's modern age, due to mental disorders like work, anger, greed, fascination, satisfaction, etc., man has become so restless that he has a craving for natural sleep as well. Today, the disease of insomnia is spreading like a disease in the whole world. Sleeplessness has become a common complaint in today's era - regular patients come to the doctors, whose special complaint is that of sleeplessness.</p><h2>Why a Sleep is needed?</h2><p>Sleep is a process by which the body gets rest. By deep sleep, the person finds himself stress-free, because it gives complete relief to the mind and body. When we wake up in the morning, our mind lightens and freshens the body.</p><p><br>If we are not able to sleep properly in the night, then we have lethargy since morning and it hurts hands and feet. The eyes remain heavy and do not feel like doing any work, that is, the next day becomes useless along with the night. Deep sleep is very important for good health, if there is no sleep for many days, then the person goes mad, the dose we get from sleep is not from anything else.<br><br>Dr. George Stevenson, an expert in mind health, says that for today's very busy and confused life, it is necessary to take care of the need and importance of sleep. At least 6 hours of sleep is necessary to maintain mental balance and health.</p><h2>How long should you sleep?</h2><p>The requirement of sleep is different for different people, like- 21 hours for a child of one month, 18 hours for a child of 6 months, 12 hours for a child of 12 months, 10 hours for a child above 12 years, 16 Those above the age of 8 hours and those above 30 years should sleep for 6-7 hours and those above 40Â should sleep 5-6 hours.<br><br>Those who do physical and mental labor get more sleep. In addition to insomnia, staying asleep for a long time is also a sign of laziness and is detrimental to health. According to England psychiatric doctor Zomz, excess sleep affects blood flow, ie it slows down. Heart diseases can occur as a result, the lungs become weak.</p><h2>Using Sleeping Pills</h2><p>It is not good to resort to drugs to get good sleep. Eating sleeping pills adversely affects health.<br><br>Regarding the consumption of sleeping pills, a famous doctor says that you get five hours of sleep and if you consume the sleeping pill daily to make it seven hours, then some days you will get seven hours of sleep, But after some time you will also have trouble sleeping for five hours. Scientists have proved that sleeping with the head in the east direction leads to peaceful and happy sleep.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 26, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-long-should-you-sleep-requirement-of-sleep.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-long-should-you-sleep-requirement-of-sleep.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F2%2FHow-long-should-you-sleep.jpg&amp;description=How%20long%20should%20you%20sleep%3F%20Requirement%20of%20Sleep" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-long-should-you-sleep-requirement-of-sleep.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-long-should-you-sleep-requirement-of-sleep.html&amp;title=How%20long%20should%20you%20sleep%3F%20Requirement%20of%20Sleep" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/cosmopolitanism-instead-of-patriotism.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/1/responsive/cosmopolitanism-instead-of-patriotism-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/1/responsive/cosmopolitanism-instead-of-patriotism-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Cosmopolitanism instead of Patriotism"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Cosmopolitanism instead of Patriotism</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/who-was-herodotus.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Who was Herodotus?</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Herodtus-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Herodtus-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Who was Herodotus?"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/study-in-england.html"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/14/responsive/study-in-england-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/14/responsive/study-in-england-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Should You go to England for Study?"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/study-in-england.html" class="inverse">Should You go to England to Study?</a></h4><time datetime="2020-02-28T18:13" class="u-small">February 28, 2020</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/bharat-ratna-mokshagundam-visvesvaraya.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" alt="Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/bharat-ratna-mokshagundam-visvesvaraya.html" class="featured-posts__title">Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya -
