Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. When the British Government passed the Indian Independence Act 1947 to liberate Hindustan, it gave the right to join or remain independent in India or Pakistan, which ruled by the King Maharajas.</p><h2>Maharaja Harisingh</h2><p>As a result, at that time, Maharaja Harisingh of Jammu and Kashmir refused to join India or Pakistan and announced that he would compromise with both countries - Pakistan and Hindustan - by remaining independent. On 14 August 1947, Pakistan was declared and India became independent on 15 August 1947.<br><br>Pakistani rulers have since forced Maharaja Harisingh to merge Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan, but when they were not ready for it, he first made an economic blockade of Janmu-Kashmir and then made a confession on October 22, 1947. Suddenly attacked the state under cover.<br><br>Two days after the Pakistani attack on Jammu and Kashmir, on 24 October 1947, Maharaja Harisingh declared an unconditional merger of Jammu Kashmir with India and asked for military assistance from India, but since India had no air service at the time, Army sent to Kashmir by private air services ships by Nehru government. In doing so, it took 3 days for the Indian Army to reach Kashmir and as a result, in these five days, Pakistani forces got the opportunity to wreak havoc in the state to a great extent.<br><br>Jammu and Kashmir became a legal part of India on 27 October 1947 after Maharaja Harisingh accepted the merger proposal. But the Nehru government nevertheless assured that upon the establishment of peace, the desire of the people of the state to meet in India or Pakistan would be ascertained.<br><br>If seen from the perspective of today, the Nehru government was a huge mistake like the Himalayas. After this, a wrong decision was made that even after the merger was completed in terms of law, Article 370 was added to the Constitution of India and gave Kashmir a separate status from other states of India. Sheikh Abdullah was made Prime Minister and Harisingh's son Karn Singh was made Sadar princely state by removing Maharaja Harisingh from the throne.</p><h2>Sardar Patel opposes this</h2><p>Sardar Patel, opposing this, suggested that the refugees who had come to desolate from Pakistan should be settled in Jammu and Kashmir. But Sheikh Abdullah was not ready for this, so even Pt. Nehru did not like it. It would be ironic that on the basis of Maharaja Harisingh's proposal, even after the merger of Kashmir with India was completed, under Article 370 of the Constitution, Kashmir maintained a separate existence from other states.<br><br>Can a country have two legislations, two marks and two heads? India was the first country in the world where this happened. The flag of Jammu Kashmir is different till date. As long as Sheikh Abdullah remained in power, he was called Prime Minister, while all other states had chief ministers. All the states of the country had governors, Kashmir alone was a princely state.<br><br>Not only this, the citizens of India could not go to Kashmir without a visa and the decisions of the Supreme Court of India were also not applicable there. All these things gave the world an opportunity to understand and believe that Kashmir is different from India. Another major mistake of Pandit Nehru was that he took the attack of Pakistan to the United Nations, due to which he is still undecided.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 27, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistorical-facts-about-kashmir-issue.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistorical-facts-about-kashmir-issue.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F10%2Fkashmir-issue.jpg&amp;description=Historical%20Facts%20about%20Kashmir%20Issue" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistorical-facts-about-kashmir-issue.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhistorical-facts-about-kashmir-issue.html&amp;title=Historical%20Facts%20about%20Kashmir%20Issue" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/dalai-lama-ocean-of-wisdom.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/9/responsive/dalai-lama-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/9/responsive/dalai-lama-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Dalai Lama - Ocean of Wisdom"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Dalai Lama - Ocean of Wisdom</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/study-in-england.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Should You go to England to Study?</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/14/responsive/study-in-england-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/14/responsive/study-in-england-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Should You go to England for Study?"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
