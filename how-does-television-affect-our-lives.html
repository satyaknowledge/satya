Television can increase our knowledge of the outside world; there are high-quality programs that help us understand many fields of study science, medicine, the arts and so on.<br><br>Moreover, television benefits very old people, who can't often leave the house as well as patients in hospitals. It also offers non-native speakers the advantage of daily informal language practice. They can increase their vocabulary and practice listening. On the other hand, there are several serious disadvantages of television.<br><br>Of course, it provides us with a pleasant way to relax and spend our free time, but in some countries. people watch the 'boob-tube' for an average of six hours or more a day. Many children stare at a television screen for more hours each day than they do anything else, including studying and sleeping. It's clear that the tube has a powerful influence on their lives and that its influence is often negative.<br><br>Recent studies show that after only thirty seconds of television, a person's brain relaxes' the same way that it does just before the person falls asleep. Another effect of television on the human brain is that it seems to cause poor concentration.<br><br>Children who view a lot of television can often concentrate on a subject for only fifteen to twenty minutes. They can pay attention only to the amount of time between commercials.<br><br>Another disadvantage is that television often causes people to become dissatisfied with their own lives. Real-life does not seem as exciting to these people as the lives of actors on the screen. To many people, television becomes more real than reality and their own lives seem boring.<br><br>Also, many people get upset or depressed when they can't solve problems in real life as quickly as television actors seem to. Before a child is fourteen years old, he or she views eleven thousand murders on the tube. He or she begins to believe that there is nothing strange about fights, killings and other kinds of violence.<br><br>Many studies show that people become more violent after certain programs. They may even do the things that they saw in a violent show. The most negative effect of the 'boob-tube' might be people's addiction to it.<br><br>People often feel a strange and powerful need to watch television even when they don't enjoy it. Addiction to a television screen is similar to drug or alcohol addiction. People almost never believe they are addicted.<br><h2>Summary</h2><br>Television affects our lives in many ways. It provides knowledge of the outside world. It provides us good programs related to science, medicines, and arts. It entertains the old. But there are several serious disadvantages of television.<br><br>Most people watch TV for 6 hrs. a day. Children watch TV for more hours than they spend on studying and sleeping. Their studies suffer. People remain dissatisfied and life becomes boring. Violence, murders, and fight affect children. People get excited. They get addicted to TV. Its addiction is like drug addiction.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 11, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-does-television-affect-our-lives.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-does-television-affect-our-lives.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F22%2Ftv.jpg&amp;description=How%20does%20television%20affect%20our%20lives%3F%20" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-does-television-affect-our-lives.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-does-television-affect-our-lives.html&amp;title=How%20does%20television%20affect%20our%20lives%3F%20" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/pursuit-of-happiness.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/21/responsive/hapiness-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/21/responsive/hapiness-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Pursuit of Happiness"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Pursuit of Happiness - Ultimate Goal</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/egotism-is-the-most-common-fault.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Egotism is the most common fault</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/23/responsive/ego-is-the-common-fault-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/23/responsive/ego-is-the-common-fault-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Egotism is the most common fault"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How does smoking affect your body"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="inverse">How does smoking affect your body?</a></h4><time datetime="2020-03-13T18:50" class="u-small">March 13, 2020</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
