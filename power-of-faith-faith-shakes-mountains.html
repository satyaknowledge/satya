The life of the bond of faith cannot stagger. Many complications, problems, storms, storms also can not distract the person from his mission, who is walking with unwavering faith in himself.<br><br>All the lamps which give light in life should be extinguished, but if the light of faith is kept burning inside the human being, it will find its own path even in the darkest darkness. All the darkness of the world disappears in front of the flame of confidence.<br><br>All the great things that have been done in the world are the works of faith. Mahatma Gandhi's strong faith made the dream of independence of the country come true. Tilak ji had said- "Swarajya is our birthright and we will keep it." His conviction later became tangible.<br><br>Lincoln wrote in his diary, and also told the people - "I have promised my God that I must complete the work of the emancipation of slaves." Despite many protests, Lincoln did that great work.<br><br>Columbus believed some cool across the vast ocean. He finally discovered America after his adventurous journey. Faith is the key to a successful life. Tolstoy wrote - "Faith is the power of life." Shakespeare said - what can "faith" not do? Faith gives us the strength and motivation to cross the skyscrapers.<br><br>Faith is the basis of all the gifts of life. Swet Marden has written- "Faith seeks the path of life that can lead us to the destination". Mahatma Gandhi said- "Faith also plays our life in the stormy sea.<br><br>Faith shakes mountains. Can transcend the vast ocean. Faith is not a soft flower that falls from the breath of ordinary air. He is immutable like the Himalayas. "<br><br>Where there is faith, all the lack of life, curse, lowliness, poverty, poverty, and poor feeling become. They do not become an impediment to the development of life. The life of most of the great men of the world proves this fact, who had little support to grow, they achieved great successes in life by their self-help. Many people became extraordinary based on their faith.<br><br>To achieve success in any field, it is necessary to have faith to move forward. If there is no power of faith behind the fulfillment of any goal, then it will be established in its initial period itself. In the absence of faith, human life becomes dry and lifeless. Inertia grabs its net.<br><br>In the absence of faith, even on the Rajpath, a man cannot move forward. Faith is not an object to be found elsewhere or a blessing of one's grace. This is the eternal truth that lies within our space.<br><br>Self-consciousness, Ajar-Akshar, All-powerful, divine form can be the basis of our faith. Man himself is the owner of renewable power and funds. Power is the third source of prosperity in human difference. When it is introduced, conviction arises.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 9, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpower-of-faith-faith-shakes-mountains.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpower-of-faith-faith-shakes-mountains.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F20%2FFaith.jpg&amp;description=Power%20of%20Faith%20-%20Faith%20shakes%20mountains" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpower-of-faith-faith-shakes-mountains.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fpower-of-faith-faith-shakes-mountains.html&amp;title=Power%20of%20Faith%20-%20Faith%20shakes%20mountains" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-satisfaction-is-needed.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/19/responsive/Satisfaction-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/19/responsive/Satisfaction-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Why Satisfaction is needed"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Why Satisfaction is needed?</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/pursuit-of-happiness.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Pursuit of Happiness - Ultimate Goal</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/21/responsive/hapiness-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/21/responsive/hapiness-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Pursuit of Happiness"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
