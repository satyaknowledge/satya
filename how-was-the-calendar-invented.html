The calendar of babylon is mentioned in 4700 BC, and the Babylonians first made months based on astronomy, excluding superstition.<br><br>Calendar means division of days. This word is from the Greek 'calendae' which means the first day of the Roman month, and is formed by adding 'r'. All the important dates of that month were announced in Rome on the first day of the month. Actually the calendar is not the gift of any country. Different countries have contributed to it from time to time. Egypt first created the calendar.</p><h2>Evolution of Calendar</h2><p><br>It is believed that there were 12 months in this calendar. The number of days was thirty in all the months. Each month was divided into ten days of ten days each. Thousands of years ago, possibly the Egyptians understood the importance of the 'decimal system'. Days were known by number. At the end of the year, the days, days and nights were equal, five days were added, but they were not counted in the year.<br><br>Like Egypt, Greece and China also made their own calendars, but the creation of the most popular calendar in the world is attributed to the ruler of Rome, Julius Caesar. He made certain amendments in the Egyptian calendar with the help of Egyptian astronomer 'Secci Jens' and gave the world a new calendar.<br><br>He divided the days of the Egyptian calendar into odd-numbered months today. The name of the month of Quintalus was changed to July, considering its name as Aadhaar. In the normal year, keep 29 days in February and 30 days in February in the leap year. It was decided not to start the new year from March but to accept it from January 1. This revision was done in 46 BC.<br><br>Julius Caesar considered the solar year to be 365–25 days. Therefore, he decided to consider every fourth year as leap year. Julius Caesar did not make any changes in the Egyptian week. In the year 321, the Roman Emperor 'Constantine' made a change in the week. He made the week seven days by decree.<br><br>The Julian calendar was mainly revised twice. The first amendment was made eight years before Christ by the Emperor August Caesar. They wanted to rename the eighth month as August on the basis of their name; Therefore, he changed the name of 'Sexatillas' to August by the ordinance of the Roman Senate.<br><br>Due to Julius Caesar having 31 days in the month of July, 30 days in the month of Sextillas were considered 31 days in the month of August. It was taken one day from the month of February. Since then, 28 days started in February and 29 days in leap year in the normal year.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 27, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-was-the-calendar-invented.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-was-the-calendar-invented.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F8%2Fevolution-of-calendar.jpg&amp;description=How%20was%20the%20calendar%20invented%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-was-the-calendar-invented.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fhow-was-the-calendar-invented.html&amp;title=How%20was%20the%20calendar%20invented%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/i-serve-that-god-by-serving-these-millions-mahatma-gautam.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/7/responsive/serving-people-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/7/responsive/serving-people-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="I serve that God by serving these millions - Mahatma Gautam"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>I serve that God by serving these millions - Mahatma Gautam</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/dalai-lama-ocean-of-wisdom.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Dalai Lama - Ocean of Wisdom</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/9/responsive/dalai-lama-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/9/responsive/dalai-lama-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Dalai Lama - Ocean of Wisdom"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-honesty-is-naked.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/16/responsive/plato-quote-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/16/responsive/plato-quote-xs.jpg" alt="Honesty vs dishonesty"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-honesty-is-naked.html" class="featured-posts__title">Why Honesty is naked?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-to-avoid-evil.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" alt="How to avoid evil"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-to-avoid-evil.html" class="featured-posts__title">How to avoid evil?
