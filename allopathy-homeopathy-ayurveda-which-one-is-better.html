Ayurveda (Vaidyak) was the only medical system practiced in India for a long time in all these medical practices.<br><br>With the advent of the Mughals, there was a practice of Arabic and Unani systems of medicine in India. Allopathy and homeopathy medical practices were also widely publicized in India upon the establishment of the English state. Among them, Ayurvedic (Vaidya), Unani (Himkat) and allopathic three medical methods are basically based on the principle of 'Reverse medicine method'. That is, to remove the disease in them, the same medicines are often consumed, which are of virtue and righteousness against the symptoms of the disease.<br><br>In the homeopathic system of medicine, to cure a disease, a medicine similar to this disease is used. Therefore, it is called 'akin treatment method'.</p><h2>Ayurveda</h2><p><br>According to the Indian Ayurvedic texts, 'the treatment of poison is poison'. This means that Ayurveda medicine is based on similar medical principles, but the reality is not, because there are many drugs in it, which can be calculated under similar medicine.<br><br>Treatment of Ayurveda system includes all the principles of allopathy, homeopathy and natural medicine. This medical system is purely Indian, which is based on products derived from herbs, plants and animals in its land itself, drugs made from which do not have any side effects.</p><h2><br>Homeopathy</h2><p><br>There is no name of disease in homeopathy. In this, treatment is done based on the symptoms of malformations in the body. Therefore, homeopathy can also be called 'semiotic medical science'.<br><br>The substance, by which the disease is cured, is called a medicine. But in the context of homeopathy, the substance, which has the power to both cause or destroy the disease, is called medicine.<br><br>The substances by which the medicine is prepared and consumed are called drug carriers. Although drugs are generally made from herbs, plants, minerals, fauna and germs of diseases, yet in medicine, herbs and plants have a special place.<br><br>Plants are used for the prevention of diseases in all medical systems of the world. About 80% of the world's population depends on medicines derived from plants and herbs for their health care.<br><br>Both Greek and Ayurvedic methods are formally the same, as physical condition has special significance in both. Ayurveda is a purely medical system, which is far from the influence of foreign medical practices, while Unani system of medicine originated in the country of ancient Greece, which is highly influenced by the medical practices of Persia and Africa.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 26, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fallopathy-homeopathy-ayurveda-which-one-is-better.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fallopathy-homeopathy-ayurveda-which-one-is-better.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F5%2Fayurveda.jpg&amp;description=Allopathy%2C%20Homeopathy%2C%20Ayurveda%20-%20Which%20one%20is%20better%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fallopathy-homeopathy-ayurveda-which-one-is-better.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fallopathy-homeopathy-ayurveda-which-one-is-better.html&amp;title=Allopathy%2C%20Homeopathy%2C%20Ayurveda%20-%20Which%20one%20is%20better%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/you-have-to-dream-to-achieve-your-dreams.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/4/responsive/dream-achievement-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/4/responsive/dream-achievement-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="You have to dream to achieve your dreams"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>You have to dream to achieve your dreams</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/stop-eating-jaggery-an-inspirational-short-story.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Stop Eating Jaggery - An Inspirational Short Story</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/6/responsive/an-inspirational-story-stop-eating-jaggery-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/6/responsive/an-inspirational-story-stop-eating-jaggery-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Stop Eating Jaggery - An Inspirational Short Story"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-honesty-is-naked.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/16/responsive/plato-quote-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/16/responsive/plato-quote-xs.jpg" alt="Honesty vs dishonesty"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-honesty-is-naked.html" class="featured-posts__title">Why Honesty is naked?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-to-avoid-evil.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/15/responsive/avoid-evil-xs.jpg" alt="How to avoid evil"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-to-avoid-evil.html" class="featured-posts__title">How to avoid evil?
