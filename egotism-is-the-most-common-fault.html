Product of the perfectly natural desire to display oneself, egotism, which is an exaggerated form of self-display, can take such a variety of shapes that it is not always easy to discern.<br><br>Beyond any shadow of a doubt, however, it is a personal defect that ought to be constantly hunted down the scotched, for it impairs the personality, and frustrates all efforts at self-improvement.<br><br>This is the easily recognizable form of egotism that is evidenced in the person who continually talks of his own affairs. You must all have met the kind of man who is never happy when recounting his exploits and experiences in life, and whatever subject he may begin discussing you feel quite sure that he will sooner or later arrive at himself.<br><br>Although such a blatant kind of egotism is apparent to the onlooker, it may not be so easy for the egotist himself to recognize his fault. But if he can put on his guard-and it behooves each one of us to examine carefully whether we are entirely immune from this canker-there is always hope of a cure.<br><br>On the other hand, there is a type, not uncommon, which evidences its egotism by affecting a humility that is certainly not felt, and ostentatiously avoiding the use of the pronoun "I" in speech and in writing. Such affectation is an infallible sign of egotism, and it is all the more reprehensible because it is deliberately assumed by the person.<br><br>Next, we come to the individual who holds strong opinions and insists on forcing these opinions on to others. He constantly lays down the law, he knows and he jolly well insists that you shall accept his viewpoints. Here again, there is not a great difficulty in recognizing the egotistical aspect of this conduct, although it is not so easy to remove such a defect, for a person of this kind is generally possessed of a fiery temper-but again, it can be done, and recognition of the defect is the first step towards its cure.<br><br>There are two other well-known types of egotists-the over-precise person and the officious one. The former offends by his meticulous habits, his insistence on having everything just right generally connoting the way he personally wants them to be.<br><br>The officious individual succeeds in making himself most disliked because of his detestable habit of always showing or telling other people how to do things. He will glibly appeal to duty: he will continually find fault with another's way of doing things, and point out the immense superiority of his method. In his own eyes, he is always right.<br><h2>SUMMARY</h2><br>Egotism is the commonest fault of mankind. It is an exaggerated form of self meant. An egotist thinks, talks and praises no one but himself. He never recognizes display. It is a personal defect that harms and frustrated all efforts of self-improve his faults. Affectation of humility can be another form of egotism.<br><br>The imposition of his strong opinion is the sign of an egotist. Over-precise and officious persons are two other types of egotists. The first kind of person insists on having everything just right. The second category of people find fault with others and display their superiority over others.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 12, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fegotism-is-the-most-common-fault.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fegotism-is-the-most-common-fault.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F23%2Fego-is-the-common-fault.jpg&amp;description=Egotism%20is%20the%20most%20common%20fault" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fegotism-is-the-most-common-fault.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fegotism-is-the-most-common-fault.html&amp;title=Egotism%20is%20the%20most%20common%20fault" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-television-affect-our-lives.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/22/responsive/tv-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/22/responsive/tv-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How does television affect our lives"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How does television affect our lives?</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
