One side that bribes and the other one who bribes. Both taking and giving bribes are considered criminal acts, but in this regard it is often considered a matter of dispute that in both the parties related to the act of bribery, who is responsible for this act?<br><br>We should test both sides before making a definite idea in this regard.<br><br>As far as this aspect of the idea is concerned, the responsibility of the bribe-taking party is for the work done in the transaction related to the bribe. The defendants of this party say that the bribe takers are responsible for the origin of the circumstances in which the bribe transaction becomes mandatory and it becomes the compulsion of the bribe givers.<br><br>For example- when a person has to get his work done from a government office like getting a permit or license, getting a house map approved, getting water or electricity connection etc. and when after completing all the work on his behalf as per rules It sees that the concerned file does not bother with the case, then it has to be forced and bribed.<br><br>In many offices, the situation is such that all the bribe money of the entire office is taken in one place and then the necessary work is done easily and the bribe money is distributed among the concerned people.<br><br>The argument given on the basis of this situation implies that the bribe does not want to launder his money as a bribe, but he does so only when the person doing his work does not want to work without bribe. . In this way, the bribe-taking party has the real responsibility for the circulation of the bribe transaction.<br><br>On the contrary, in relation to the party of the idea, the bribe party is responsible for the act of bribery. The proponents of this view say that the people responsible for the origin of the circumstances of the bribe transaction are the people who pay the bribe.<br><br>There are some rules for obtaining permits or licenses, getting a house map approved, obtaining a combination of water or electricity or doing other similar tasks and there is a process of their completion.<br><br>In how many days there should be a work. It is also decided, but despite all this arrangement, some people want to get their work done against the rules or - before the stipulated time and they offer bribe on their behalf, not on anyone's demand for it. , So that their work can be completed despite the rules or their work can be done before the scheduled time.<br><br>There are some such works like - contracts for government works, contracts for the supply of goods, etc., for which the contractor, etc., without any demand, gives a bribe (commission) on his own behalf.<br><br>The argument that is made on the basis of this situation means that the people who actually bribe, to prove their selfishness, make the people of the other party addicted to taking bribe. And on the basis of this reasoning, it is concluded that the actual responsibility of the circulation of the bribe transaction rests with the party paying the bribe.<br><br>But if you look a little thoughtfully, both of the above ideas are one-sided. In fact, for the practice of bribery transactions, only one party who takes or gives bribes cannot be said to be guilty or liable.<br><br>Some of the rules and circumstances of the functioning of the government are such that in which the government officials and employees are in a position to give some convenience or difficulty on their own behalf and due to this, when someone wants that facility from them, then they can pay that facility fee. Taking it as their common right.<br><br>It is therefore necessary that those situations be eliminated in which the bribe taker bribes, and the bribe taker takes the bribe.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 5, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fis-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fis-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F18%2Fbribe.jpg&amp;description=Is%20it%20bad%20to%20take%20a%20bribe%3F%20Or%20offering%20a%20bribe%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fis-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fis-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html&amp;title=Is%20it%20bad%20to%20take%20a%20bribe%3F%20Or%20offering%20a%20bribe%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/bharat-ratna-mokshagundam-visvesvaraya.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/17/responsive/Bharat-Ratna-Sir-Mokshagundam-Visvesvaraya-xs.jpeg" data-expand="300" alt="Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya - A great Inspiration</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/why-satisfaction-is-needed.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Why Satisfaction is needed?</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/19/responsive/Satisfaction-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/19/responsive/Satisfaction-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Why Satisfaction is needed"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" alt="How does smoking affect your body"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="featured-posts__title">How does smoking affect your body?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
