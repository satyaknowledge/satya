                Smoking is the major cause of mortality with bronchogenic carcinoma of the lung and is one of the factors causing death due to malignancies of the larynx, oral cavity, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, and uterine cervix and coronary heart diseases. <br><br>Nicotine is the major substance present in the smoke that causes physical dependence. The additives do produce damage to the body - for example, ammonia can result in a 100-fold increase in the ability of nicotine to enter into the smoke. <br><br>Levulinic acid, added to cigarettes to mask the harsh taste of the nicotine, can increase the binding of nicotine to brain receptors, which increases the 'kick' of nicotine. Smoke from the burning end of a cigarette contains over 4000 chemicals and 40 carcinogens. It has long been known that tobacco smoke is carcinogenic or cancer-causing.<br><br>The lungs of smokers collect an annual deposit of 1 to 10 pounds of the gooey black material. The invisible gas phase of cigarette smoke contains nitrogen, oxygen and toxic gases like carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides. These gases are poisonous and in many cases interfere with the body's ability to transport oxygen.<br><br>Like many carcinogenic compounds, they can act as tumor promoters or tumor initiators by acting directly on the genetic make-up of cells the body leading to the development of cancer.<br><br>During smoking within the first 8 - 10 seconds, nicotine is absorbed through the lungs and quickly moved into the bloodstream and circulated throughout the brain. Nicotine can also enter the bloodstream through the mucous membranes that line the mouth Gif tobacco is chewed) or nose if snuff is used) and even through the skin. <br><br>Our brain is made of billions of nerve cells. They communicate with each other by chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Nicotine is one of the most powerful nerve poisons and binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic receptors located in the brain, autonomic ganglia, the medulla, neuro-muscular junctions. Located throughout the brain, they play a critical role in cognitive processes and memory.<br><br>The nicotine molecule is shaped like a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine which is involved in many functions including muscle movement, breathing, heart-rate, learning, and memory. Nicotine, because of the similar structure with acetylcholine when it gets into the brain, attaches itself to acetylcholine sites and produces toxic effects. <br><br>In high concentrations, nicotine is more deadly. In fact, one drop of purified nicotine on the tongue will kill a person. It has been used as a pesticide for centuries. Recent research studies suggest that acute nicotine administration would result in increased dopamine release from the brain, producing perceptions of pleasure and happiness, increased energy and motivation, increased alertness, increased feeling of vigor during the early phase of smoking. <br><br>However, notwithstanding these superficial effects, research shows that the relationship between smoking and memory loss is strongest in people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes each day and this is not specific to the socio-economic status, gender and a range of associated medical conditions. Smoking may speed up age-related memory loss and the details are not yet clear. Some studies suggest that repeated exposure to high nicotinic smoke related to the 'Brain-wiring' is nothing but neuro-biochemistry that deals with complex interaction among genetic experience and biochemistry of brain cells<br><br>NO' is a unique molecule that plays a role in a number of beneficial and some of the harmful brain and body mechanisms, for example, synapse formation, drug tolerance and local regulation of cerebral blood flow, Parkinson's disease, etc. It is also found that people who smoke more cigarettes a day have poorer memories in middle age than non-smokers.<br><br>Some experts say that smoking is linked to memory problems because it contributes to narrowed arteries that restrict blood flow to the brain. One of the causes of memory decline in relation to the brain function could be the nerve cell death or decreased density of interconnected neural network due to loss of dendrites, the tiny filaments which connect one nerve cell to another. Abstinence from smoking is essential, not only to avoid this systemic effect but also to reduce the ill-effects on the environment.

                Egotism is the most common fault of mankind. Product of the perfectly natural desire to display oneself, egotism, which is an exaggerated form of self-display, can take such a variety of shapes that it is not always easy to discern. <br><br>Beyond any shadow of a doubt, however, it is a personal defect that ought to be constantly hunted down the scotched, for it impairs the personality, and frustrates all efforts at self-improvement.<br><br>This is the easily recognizable form of egotism that is evidenced in the person who continually talks of his own affairs. You must all have met the kind of man who is never happy when recounting his exploits and experiences in life, and whatever subject he may begin discussing you feel quite sure that he will sooner or later arrive at himself. <br><br>Although such a blatant kind of egotism is apparent to the onlooker, it may not be so easy for the egotist himself to recognize his fault. But if he can put on his guard-and it behooves each one of us to examine carefully whether we are entirely immune from this canker-there is always hope of a cure. <br><br>On the other hand, there is a type, not uncommon, which evidences its egotism by affecting a humility that is certainly not felt, and ostentatiously avoiding the use of the pronoun "I" in speech and in writing. Such affectation is an infallible sign of egotism, and it is all the more reprehensible because it is deliberately assumed by the person. <br><br>Next, we come to the individual who holds strong opinions and insists on forcing these opinions on to others. He constantly lays down the law, he knows and he jolly well insists that you shall accept his viewpoints. Here again, there is not a great difficulty in recognizing the egotistical aspect of this conduct, although it is not so easy to remove such a defect, for a person of this kind is generally possessed of a fiery temper-but again, it can be done, and recognition of the defect is the first step towards its cure. <br><br>There are two other well-known types of egotists-the over-precise person and the officious one. The former offends by his meticulous habits, his insistence on having everything just right generally connoting the way he personally wants them to be. <br><br>The officious individual succeeds in making himself most disliked because of his detestable habit of always showing or telling other people how to do things. He will glibly appeal to duty: he will continually find fault with another's way of doing things, and point out the immense superiority of his method. In his own eyes, he is always right.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e3740i680">SUMMARY</h2>
<br>Egotism is the commonest fault of mankind. It is an exaggerated form of self meant. An egotist thinks, talks and praises no one but himself. He never recognizes display. It is a personal defect that harms and frustrated all efforts of self-improve his faults. Affectation of humility can be another form of egotism. <br><br>The imposition of his strong opinion is the sign of an egotist. Over-precise and officious persons are two other types of egotists. The first kind of person insists on having everything just right. The second category of people find fault with others and display their superiority over others.

                It can be very helpful to people who carefully choose the shows that they watch. Television can increase our knowledge of the outside world; there are high-quality programs that help us understand many fields of study science, medicine, the arts and so on. <br><br>Moreover, television benefits very old people, who can't often leave the house as well as patients in hospitals. It also offers non-native speakers the advantage of daily informal language practice. They can increase their vocabulary and practice listening. On the other hand, there are several serious disadvantages of television. <br><br>Of course, it provides us with a pleasant way to relax and spend our free time, but in some countries. people watch the 'boob-tube' for an average of six hours or more a day. Many children stare at a television screen for more hours each day than they do anything else, including studying and sleeping. It's clear that the tube has a powerful influence on their lives and that its influence is often negative. <br><br>Recent studies show that after only thirty seconds of television, a person's brain relaxes' the same way that it does just before the person falls asleep. Another effect of television on the human brain is that it seems to cause poor concentration. <br><br>Children who view a lot of television can often concentrate on a subject for only fifteen to twenty minutes. They can pay attention only to the amount of time between commercials. <br><br>Another disadvantage is that television often causes people to become dissatisfied with their own lives. Real-life does not seem as exciting to these people as the lives of actors on the screen. To many people, television becomes more real than reality and their own lives seem boring. <br><br>Also, many people get upset or depressed when they can't solve problems in real life as quickly as television actors seem to. Before a child is fourteen years old, he or she views eleven thousand murders on the tube. He or she begins to believe that there is nothing strange about fights, killings and other kinds of violence. <br><br>Many studies show that people become more violent after certain programs. They may even do the things that they saw in a violent show. The most negative effect of the 'boob-tube' might be people's addiction to it. <br><br>People often feel a strange and powerful need to watch television even when they don't enjoy it. Addiction to a television screen is similar to drug or alcohol addiction. People almost never believe they are addicted.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e34quub40">Summary</h2>
<br>Television affects our lives in many ways. It provides knowledge of the outside world. It provides us good programs related to science, medicines, and arts. It entertains the old. But there are several serious disadvantages of television. <br><br>Most people watch TV for 6 hrs. a day. Children watch TV for more hours than they spend on studying and sleeping. Their studies suffer. People remain dissatisfied and life becomes boring. Violence, murders, and fight affect children. People get excited. They get addicted to TV. Its addiction is like drug addiction.

                To date, happiness has defied definition. Most people tend to equate happiness with fun, good living, plenty of money. If happiness were synonymous with all this, rich people with all their luxuries and countless parties would be perpetually happy. But in actual fact, they are, frequently, acutely unhappy, despite their riches and ability to indulge in fun activities at will. Fun is what we experience during an act; happiness is that intangible something we experience after an act. We may have fun watching a movie, going shopping, meeting friends-these are all fun activities that afford us fleeting moments of relaxation and enjoyment. Happiness, on the other hand, is a much stronger, deeper and more abiding emotion.<br><br>If we perceive happiness as the ultimate goal, we must also devise a way to reach that goal. The way to happiness is not a smooth, broad highway along which we can cruise at a comfortable speed. It is a path through rocky and rugged terrain and the going can become very tough at times. At these times we have to roll up our sleeves and with pitchfork and shovel make our way onwards. This pursuit of happiness lasts a lifetime. Great happiness is earned only by great effort and effort not in spurts but diligent, constant effort. In this connection we are confronted with another fallacy, that fun and pleasure mean happiness and thus pain, its corollary, must be synonymous with unhappiness. But in fact, the truth is quite different. Things that bring us happiness, more often than not, involve some amount of pain. It is because of the misconception that people avoid the very endeavor that is the source of true happiness. Difficult endeavors - such as the raising of children, establishing deeper relationships with loved ones, trying to do something worthwhile in life - hold the promise of a world of happiness.<br>Happiness is not a permanent vacation. Another prevalent belief is that if one were rich enough not to have to work one would be blissfully happy. But a job is more than just a paycheque. Almost all religions teach us that work is worship. Work holds the key to happiness as doing something which increases confidence and self-worth. It brings on a feeling of satisfaction, of doing something, of contributing. Job satisfaction comes less from how much one earns than from the challenge of the job. Of course the pay-cheques count. It would be unrealistic to suggest that one could be happy without basic shelter, roaming the streets on an empty stomach.<br><br>A secret ingredient of happiness is contentment. Contentment here does not mean apathy or lack of ambition, just as commitment does not mean curtailment of freedom. Commitment teaches us to give so that we may receive and contentment helps us to cherish the gifts we have received. These things are worth a try even if they don't promise access to the pinnacle of success. Success, after all, has been described as getting what one wants, whereas happiness is liking what one gets.<br>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e3252cuo0">Summary</h2>
<br>Happiness defies definition. It is not synonymous with fun, good living or wealth. The rich are unhappy in spite of all these things. Fun activities give us only fleeting moments of enjoyment. Happiness, on the other hand, is a deeper and more abiding emotion. The way to happiness is not smooth. We have to make your own way. The pursuit of happiness is a long and lifetime experience. It is a fallacy to equate happiness with fun and pleasure. Work holds the key to happiness. Contentment brings happiness. Success means getting what one wants but happiness is liking what one gets.

                Faith is the helm of human life, which keeps it dynamic and stable even in millions of contrasts, complications. The life of the bond of faith cannot stagger. Many complications, problems, storms, storms also can not distract the person from his mission, who is walking with unwavering faith in himself.<br><br>All the lamps which give light in life should be extinguished, but if the light of faith is kept burning inside the human being, it will find its own path even in the darkest darkness. All the darkness of the world disappears in front of the flame of confidence.<br><br>All the great things that have been done in the world are the works of faith. Mahatma Gandhi's strong faith made the dream of independence of the country come true. Tilak ji had said- "Swarajya is our birthright and we will keep it." His conviction later became tangible.<br><br>Lincoln wrote in his diary, and also told the people - "I have promised my God that I must complete the work of the emancipation of slaves." Despite many protests, Lincoln did that great work.<br><br>Columbus believed some cool across the vast ocean. He finally discovered America after his adventurous journey. Faith is the key to a successful life. Tolstoy wrote - "Faith is the power of life." Shakespeare said - what can "faith" not do? Faith gives us the strength and motivation to cross the skyscrapers.<br><br>Faith is the basis of all the gifts of life. Swet Marden has written- "Faith seeks the path of life that can lead us to the destination". Mahatma Gandhi said- "Faith also plays our life in the stormy sea.<br><br>Faith shakes mountains. Can transcend the vast ocean. Faith is not a soft flower that falls from the breath of ordinary air. He is immutable like the Himalayas. "<br><br>Where there is faith, all the lack of life, curse, lowliness, poverty, poverty, and poor feeling become. They do not become an impediment to the development of life. The life of most of the great men of the world proves this fact, who had little support to grow, they achieved great successes in life by their self-help. Many people became extraordinary based on their faith.<br><br>To achieve success in any field, it is necessary to have faith to move forward. If there is no power of faith behind the fulfillment of any goal, then it will be established in its initial period itself. In the absence of faith, human life becomes dry and lifeless. Inertia grabs its net.<br><br>In the absence of faith, even on the Rajpath, a man cannot move forward. Faith is not an object to be found elsewhere or a blessing of one's grace. This is the eternal truth that lies within our space.<br><br>Self-consciousness, Ajar-Akshar, All-powerful, divine form can be the basis of our faith. Man himself is the owner of renewable power and funds. Power is the third source of prosperity in human difference. When it is introduced, conviction arises.

                In a bribery case, two sides are usually involved. One side that bribes and the other one who bribes. Both taking and giving bribes are considered criminal acts, but in this regard it is often considered a matter of dispute that in both the parties related to the act of bribery, who is responsible for this act?<br><br>We should test both sides before making a definite idea in this regard.<br><br>As far as this aspect of the idea is concerned, the responsibility of the bribe-taking party is for the work done in the transaction related to the bribe. The defendants of this party say that the bribe takers are responsible for the origin of the circumstances in which the bribe transaction becomes mandatory and it becomes the compulsion of the bribe givers.<br><br>For example- when a person has to get his work done from a government office like getting a permit or license, getting a house map approved, getting water or electricity connection etc. and when after completing all the work on his behalf as per rules It sees that the concerned file does not bother with the case, then it has to be forced and bribed.<br><br>In many offices, the situation is such that all the bribe money of the entire office is taken in one place and then the necessary work is done easily and the bribe money is distributed among the concerned people.<br><br>The argument given on the basis of this situation implies that the bribe does not want to launder his money as a bribe, but he does so only when the person doing his work does not want to work without bribe. . In this way, the bribe-taking party has the real responsibility for the circulation of the bribe transaction.<br><br>On the contrary, in relation to the party of the idea, the bribe party is responsible for the act of bribery. The proponents of this view say that the people responsible for the origin of the circumstances of the bribe transaction are the people who pay the bribe.<br><br>There are some rules for obtaining permits or licenses, getting a house map approved, obtaining a combination of water or electricity or doing other similar tasks and there is a process of their completion.<br><br>In how many days there should be a work. It is also decided, but despite all this arrangement, some people want to get their work done against the rules or - before the stipulated time and they offer bribe on their behalf, not on anyone's demand for it. , So that their work can be completed despite the rules or their work can be done before the scheduled time.<br><br>There are some such works like - contracts for government works, contracts for the supply of goods, etc., for which the contractor, etc., without any demand, gives a bribe (commission) on his own behalf.<br><br>The argument that is made on the basis of this situation means that the people who actually bribe, to prove their selfishness, make the people of the other party addicted to taking bribe. And on the basis of this reasoning, it is concluded that the actual responsibility of the circulation of the bribe transaction rests with the party paying the bribe.<br><br>But if you look a little thoughtfully, both of the above ideas are one-sided. In fact, for the practice of bribery transactions, only one party who takes or gives bribes cannot be said to be guilty or liable.<br><br>Some of the rules and circumstances of the functioning of the government are such that in which the government officials and employees are in a position to give some convenience or difficulty on their own behalf and due to this, when someone wants that facility from them, then they can pay that facility fee. Taking it as their common right.<br><br>It is therefore necessary that those situations be eliminated in which the bribe taker bribes, and the bribe taker takes the bribe.

                <p>Our elders often teach us that we should always be honest, conduct truth, perform our duty and help the weak and poor.<br><br>In fact, these are some moral beliefs, which we have considered to be very important for our lives and whose official practice we have been trying to do. The reason we have done this has been that we consider these moral beliefs to be a means of making our life happy and believe that without them human life becomes distorted and painful.<br><br>But on the contrary, when we see that those who live a life of untruth, cheating and dishonesty are not happy, but vice versa, then it becomes questionable that moral beliefs like truth, duty and honesty etc. should be given to us. Whether to base Because it is a matter of experience that every person in the world shows truth, truthfulness and honesty for goodness and it says that these should be the basis of our life.<br><br>But in actual practice, innumerable people appear to be giving up these ideals when they see that walking on them does not solve the real problems of life and people who do not care for them lead a more happy life in the world. Why do most people not accept truth and honesty? In this context, a story related to dishonesty and honesty is very relevant.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e288nufp1">Honesty and Dishonesty</h2>
<p>It is said that once honesty and dishonesty went to bathe in a river. After taking off their clothes for bathing, both of them took a dip in the river with the race to take a long dip. Dishonesty came out of the water quickly due to its tendency and after wearing the clothes of honesty, went away from there.<br><br>When honesty later came out of the water and could not find her clothes on the banks of the river, she was confused because she did not want to be dishonest by wearing Dishonesty's clothes. In such a situation, he thought to be nude.<br><br>It is said that since then, honesty is naked and her clothes have been worn by Dishonesty. As a result, people who want to avoid nudity, adopt Dishonesty wearing honesty clothes and remain attuned to them as long as they can recognize the reality of Dishonesty. Because many problems of people are easily solved with the help of it.<br><br>According to the story, this is the reason that honesty has fallen alone in the world and there are very few people to adopt it; Whereas people who adopt dishonesty and live with it are numerous and they do not consider it bad but good.</p>

                The famous scholar Tacitus has said that "As long as humans live, evil will remain."<br><br>The greatest feature of evil is that it forces the holder to find his / her ambition elsewhere. As a result, no one is able to see their evils and does not even try to remove them. As a result, he continues to provide the birth protection of his evildoer and his unrestrained side continues to be confirmed.<br><br>Per-dosha philosophy means that a person who is busy in seeing the evil of others, remains ignorant of the insects inside him towards his evil. This is why it is said that Dosh Darshan is the biggest flaw or evil But the situation is such that no one blames himself in 99 percent of situations, no matter how big his mistake is.<br><br>Swami Ramathirtha says that 'अपनी आँख में शहतीर देख पाने की अपेक्षा दूसरों की आँख में तिनका देख लेना सरल है.'<br><br>Therefore, we should first avoid the evil called dosha-darshan and the simple solution to this is that we should practice watching our evils. We will see that the evils that we see in other people are present in us. Saint Kabir Das has said that<br><br>बुरा जो देखन मैं चला, बुरा मिला न कोय । जो दिल खोजा आपना, मुझसा बुरा न कोय ॥<br><br>Therefore, if we know our evils and try to remove them one by one, we will do a lot of work in life and ourselves will also become a good and big person. As soon as we start looking towards our faults or our evils, as we start to consider others as bad and blame them for our sufferings.<br><br>A famous thinker has spoken of great importance in this context - "Ordinary people blame each other for their evil."<br><br>Thinking of evil in any form casts a dark shadow on the mind. Clashes and discord arise due to the thought of evil or its discussion. The action of which karma results in discord and affliction, there is no benefit, but only loss. The best and best way to avoid evils is not to discuss them, and try to remove our evils one by one. Goods will be reputed by them in their spaces.<br><br>Acharya Vinoba Bhave has said that "Bad things should be forgotten. If we keep looking at the bad things, then people will become cruel."<br><br>Benjamin Franklin has also said- "Let your evils die before you."
