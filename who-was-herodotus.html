He gave birth to the art of writing history. For this reason, he is called the 'father of history'.<br><br>For the first time, he wrote the history of the Persian invasion of Greece in a flowing and smooth style. He described the vastness and diversity of the Persian army in a very interesting style. Herodotus was born in Asia Minor in a place called Halikarnasus, Korea, around 484 BC. He died at the age of 56 in Thuri Lutium, Italy, in about 428 BC.<br><br>Staying in Thuri, he wrote history in 9 volumes in 'Ionic' language. It has a pre-history of Persia, Lydia and Miss and specifically mentions the battle of Greece and Persia. This history dates back to 479 BC. This mainly gives us a lot of knowledge about Marathan Thermopoly and Salamis.<br><br>In this book, along with the events, there is a detailed look at the social, political, economic, cultural and religious life of the time. He spent his entire life wandering here and there like a journey.<br><br>A detailed and vivid description of history and geography is found in his writings. Along with the living and customs and conduct of the society of the then Greece, he has also depicted eminent personalities. The beautiful coordination between emotional expression and thought expression in his immortal texts is rare elsewhere.<br><br>The great historian Edward Gibbon (AD 17371794) wrote that Herodotus writes sometimes for children, sometimes for philosophers. Regarding Herodotus' extraordinary personality and immense work, Alfred D. Gadley has written a large volume called 'Herodotus' in 4 volumes, published in London in 1920-24 AD. It was in his fifty six years that he traveled to the then spinning nations.<br><br>He had said- "Travel brings perfection to life. Unreached, unknown, unseen places and things come into contact, blocking the doors of knowledge opens. The horizon of contemplation of the person becomes wider and the work of right and balanced Get inspiration for Kalap. "<br><br>In this statement, there is a part of truth, in reality, life is not complete only by studying the great books of theory. For the sake of its perfection, to give condition and form to the principle, the Kanakabha lines of behavior have to be of the nature of spiritual practice.<br><br>Walking like a 'rover', he traveled to Babylon, Egypt, Italy and Persia. Apart from this, he also visited other small African countries of the Mediterranean Sea. He wrote in history only what he saw and heard during his visit to various countries.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on February 26, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwho-was-herodotus.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwho-was-herodotus.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F3%2FHerodtus.jpg&amp;description=Who%20was%20Herodotus%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwho-was-herodotus.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fwho-was-herodotus.html&amp;title=Who%20was%20Herodotus%3F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-long-should-you-sleep-requirement-of-sleep.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/2/responsive/How-long-should-you-sleep-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/2/responsive/How-long-should-you-sleep-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How long should you sleep?"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How long should you sleep?
