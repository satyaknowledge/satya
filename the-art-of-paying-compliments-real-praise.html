It's the valued gold coin of our conversation. Yet today, it is in danger of losing its brightness. For it is greatly misused and not properly exchanged. What is a true compliment ? It's one that benefits both giver and receiver. Once a painter and his young assistant were painting our house. The older man was wearing shiny new shoes.<br><br>As the man sta: skilfully painting, my father-in-law, said to the boy, "Son, when you can show up on the job to paint a house, wearing new shoes, you will be the master of your trade." The painter smiled and did the best job. We all like to have our sense of personal worth built up or pointed out. And when one expert adds to another's sense of dignity and speaks favourably of his skill, he is offering a compliment of the highest and rarest kind.<br><br>A compliment differs from flattery in that it is objective and given without thought of gain. Flattery is often merely lip service or excessive praise given for motives other than expressed.<br><br>The greatest efforts of the human race have always resulted from the love of praise. This should be inspired in childhood. The wise parent makes it a point to compliment a child who deserves it. A woman I know has a 12 year old son who considers washing dishes for his mother a great honour. One night, while washing a large dish, it slipped and crashed on the floor. Then his mother said, "You know, Robert, of all the times you have washed the dishes for me, this is the first time you dropped one." Anxiety left the boy's face and he smiled. As one psychologist advises, "Praise virtue and you will find few vices to criticise."<br>There is an art in this giving of compliments. Thus the good compliment is always to the<br><br>point and timing is important. Don't wait too long to tell a person what a good talk he gave or how well he cut your grass. But don't do it immediately when he is expecting it either. Wait. Then when he thinks you may have forgotten, pass the praise.<br><br>Confidence, it has been said, is the greatest gift that one human can give to another. But that does not mean we should be wasteful with our compliments. Rather we should count them carefully remembering that a good compliment has greater purchasing power than money, that no one is too busy or successful to receive a word of praise.<br><h2>Summary</h2><br>A sincere compliment is the most useful social tool. Unfortunately, it is misused and not properly exchanged. A true compliment benefits both, the giver and the receiver. A compliment is different from flattery. It is objective and without any motive. The love of praise has motivated the greatest achievements of human race. If we praise virtue, we will find few vices to criticise. A good compliment is always precise. Timing is also important. We should not be wasteful with our compliments. A good compliment has more purchasing power than money. Everyone desires and loves to have it.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 19, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-paying-compliments-real-praise.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-paying-compliments-real-praise.html&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F25%2F1__3f0rAE9uPUFeQ2WoguQxw.jpeg&amp;description=The%20art%20of%20paying%20compliments%20-%20Real%20Praise" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-paying-compliments-real-praise.html" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.satyaknowledge.com%2Fthe-art-of-paying-compliments-real-praise.html&amp;title=The%20art%20of%20paying%20compliments%20-%20Real%20Praise" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio u-author box"><div><h4 class="u-author__name"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/authors/narender-singh/" title="Narender Singh">Narender Singh</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="How does smoking affect your body"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How does smoking affect your body?</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/liberals-and-marxists.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Liberals and Marxists - Liberalism And Marxism Politics</h5></div><img class="lazyload" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/26/responsive/2000px-Forms_of_government.svg-xs.png" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/26/responsive/2000px-Forms_of_government.svg-xs.png" data-expand="300" alt="Liberals and Marxists"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/24/responsive/smoking-kills-xs.jpg" alt="How does smoking affect your body"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/how-does-smoking-affect-your-body.html" class="featured-posts__title">How does smoking affect your body?</a></div></li><li><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html"><img class="lazyload featured-posts__img" src="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" data-srcset="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/media/posts/18/responsive/bribe-xs.jpg" alt="Is it bad to take a bribe or bribe"></a><div><a href="http://www.satyaknowledge.com/is-it-bad-to-take-a-bribe-or-offering-a-bribe.html" class="featured-posts__title">Is it bad to take a bribe?
